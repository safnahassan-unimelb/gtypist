NAME : SAFNA HASSAN
MIS NO. : 111505048

I have tried to make a typing tutor, that allows the user to learn typing slowly, one lesson at a time,  with several lessons for different keyboards( qwerty and dvorak ). Diffeent options are :
QWERTY TOUCH typing, QUICK QWERTY course, QWERTY REVIEW, LONG QWERTY course, DVORAK touch typing, DRILLS and SPEED TESTs.
My typing tutor gives the user run tine options too, such as :
	set default maximum error percentage (default 3.0)
  set scoring mode (w - words per minute or c - characters per minute)
  help option
  output version information and exit
  
Happy typing!
